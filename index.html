    <h2>Saint-Lary 1700 - The Plat d'Adet</h2>
    
    <p>Saint-Lary 1700 is also called the Plat d'Adet.<br> 
    This is <strong>the historical part of Saint-Lary located at the arrival of the ski lifts from the village and just in front of most of the high altitude accommodation.</strong> This area has recently been redeveloped and designed to accommodate beginners, families and children.
    <br>
    </br>
    There are of course ski schools, the Piou Piou club (snow garden), but also toboggan runs and snow games.
    <br>
    A playful track is available, the Kidpark is served, as well as the school slope by covered conveyors for the greatest comfort of children. The green track of the Scarf offers an easy path along the snow front winding up to the "Cabane" sector. This track is bordered by a wooden boardwalk so that the guides can follow the evolution of the beginners. This is also the case for the school slope.
    </br>
    <br>
    <em>The Plat d'Adet chairlifts also allow you to climb up to 2300m in Soum de Matte, either to enjoy long walks on blue paths back to the starting point, or to take the more technical slopes of this area (red and black) or to project yourself on the following areas, Saint-Lary 1900 and Saint-Lary 2400.</em>
    </br>

    <h2>Saint-Lary 1900 - Espiaube</h2>
    <p>Saint-Lary 1900 "Espiaube" <em>is an intermediate sector that starts from 1650 m. at the Espiaube car parks.</em> It is both a transitional area since it is crossed by blue or red trails to access the upper parts of the resort, and a rather sporty area with very beautiful red and black trails located for many in the forest on a northern slope.
    <br>
    </br>
    But <strong>Saint-Lary 1900 is also very long slopes of more than 3 kms </strong>such as Mirabelle or Terranère which are among the most appreciated of the resort. Mirabelle is served by 2 detachable chairlifts and a cable car and half of it has a high altitude restaurant accessible to pedestrians.

    </div>
    <h2>Saint-Lary 2400 - The Vallon</h2>
    <p>Crossing the ridge line, we discover Saint-Lary 2400 "Vallon du Portet", a real jewel since this high altitude sector, located above 2000m, offers a wide range of slopes, optimal sunshine and a 360° view of the Pyrenees. We are here at the border of the National Park when we reach Lake L'Oulle. <strong>There are high-altitude restaurants accessible to non-skiers, sliding areas, the Snowpark and a 3 km cross-country ski run.</strong></p>
